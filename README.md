The Pomodoro Technique is a way of optimising your workflow. 

The main principle is :

* Breaking down work into intervals (usually 25 mn), separated by short breaks (around 5 mn). 
* Every 4 (or 5) Pomodori sessions, a longer break is taken (traditionally 20 mn). 
* And the cycle starts again (Pomodoro session, short break, pomodoro session, short break.... long break...)

This technique has been developed by Francesco Cirrillo in the late 80's.
